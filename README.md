Repo for displaying project code.
My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a thorough understanding 
of the use of arrays, loops, mouse functions and keyboard functions. I created a bouncing balls in which 
details of each ball (e.g. position, ball color, speed, size and shape) 
are stored in parallel arrays. A bouncing ball is added whenever a user clicks inside the window and 
when a user drags the mouse  multiple balls would be added inside the window, also, 
there's a "println()" funtion which display the amount of balls inside the window. 
However, the balls can be controlled using some letters on the keyboard (Keyboard Functions) which are: 
"p" - to pause/play the balls and 
"r" - to reset the balls in the window.
