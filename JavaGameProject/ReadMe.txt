This is a doodle jump game. The Cowboy character can be controlled by the “arrow keys” or with the letter “a” & “d” which allows the character to move left or right and the “spacebar key” enables the Cowboy character to jump higher.  As we can see we have the Health balls and the Zombies. There’s a collusion between them and the cowboy character, when the cowboy character collides with the Zombie the health is reduced by 20 and when it collides with the Health ball, the health increases by 1.  The Cowboy character can only progress to the next level if only the conditions are met for each level. The Cowboy character would be able to move to level 2 if he’s able to pick up 6 health balls.
Also, the timer is been used to deploy the rock (bomb) in the game. The rock can be dropped when the letter “b” key is being pressed and gets explode after 3 seconds. The rock destroys the health ball and zombie character due to the collision event between them. Buttons are implemented on the GUI for different functionality. The pause & resume buttons allow the player to stop and continue the game without quitting the application. The restart button allows the player to reload a particular level of the game. The save and load buttons allows the player to save any level of the game and come back to it later to load the game which helps the player to continue playing the game from the saved level. The current score and health are displayed on the screen for the player to see. At the end of the game the high score window is being displayed where the player can save their current high score by inputting player name and can also see previous high scores data being stored.
